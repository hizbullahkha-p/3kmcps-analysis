        <h2>Bonding</h2>
        <p>The molecular docking analysis revealed that 9-(3-hydroxy-2-methoxy-3-methylbutyl)-8-methoxy-6a,11a-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[3,2-c]chromen-3-ol penetrated deeply into the catalytic site of TACE, owing to its elongated and slightly flexible molecular structure. It interacted with key amino acid residues through various types of bonding, including hydrogen bonds and pi-based interactions.</p>
        
        <h2>Conventional Hydrogen Bond</h2>
        <p>A conventional hydrogen bond was formed with Gly-349 at a distance of 2.19 Å...</p>
        
        <h2>Pi-Sigma Hydrogen Bond</h2>
        <p>A pi-sigma interaction was observed between the imidazole ring of His-409...</p>
        
        <h2>Pi-Anion and Charge-Charge Hydrogen Bond</h2>
        <p>A significant interaction observed was a pi-anion interaction between the oxygen atom of Glu-406...</p>
        
        <h2>Alkyl Interactions and Pi-Alkyl Interaction Hydrogen Bond</h2>
        <p>Carbon 6a was involved in hydrophobic alkyl interactions with Ala-349, Leu-348, and Val-402...</p>
        
        <h2>Pi-Pi-stacked Hydrogen Bond</h2>
        <p>The imidazole ring of His-405 formed a π-π-stacked hydrogen bond with the benzene ring...</p>
        
        <h2>Carbon Hydrogen Bond</h2>
        <p>The oxygen atom of Thr-347 formed a carbon-hydrogen bond (CH···O) with the 8-methoxy group...</p>
        
        <h2>Pi-Donor Hydrogen Bond</h2>
        <p>The nitrogen atom in Val-440, at a distance of 2.86 Å, had an attached hydrogen forming a π-Donor Hydrogen Bond...</p>
        
        <h2>Unfavorable Bump Hydrogen Bond</h2>
        <p>The carbon atom of Leu-350 formed two unfavorable bump hydrogen bonds with the 3-methyl group...</p>
